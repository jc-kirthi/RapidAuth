  RapidAuth: End-to-End Document Integrity System for Academic Credentials
</h1>

# 📌 Project Description

RapidAuth is a blockchain-based credential verification platform that enables educational institutions to issue tamper-proof digital documents as verifiable claims on the Algorand blockchain.

The system creates a unified, transparent layer for the entire document lifecycle:
- Issuance  
- Student control  
- Verification  
- Revocation  
- Audit  

Across all college-issued credentials.

# 🚨 The Problem

Educational institutions face a credential crisis:

- Students wait days for simple documents like NOCs and bonafide certificates.
- Recruiters spend weeks verifying marksheets and internship proofs.
- 68% of recruiters admit they cannot verify every document thoroughly.
- Fake documents cost Indian companies an estimated ₹1,200 crore annually.
- College staff spend 40–50% of their time handling verification requests.

### ❌ Existing Solutions Fail

- DigiLocker excludes college-level issuance.
- Academic ERPs lack external verification capability.
- Most blockchain solutions focus only on degrees.
- NOCs, LORs, internships, and achievement certificates are ignored.

# 🔗 Smart Contract (Algorand Testnet)


## 📜 Core Smart Contract Functions

### ✅ Issuer Whitelist
Only pre-approved wallet addresses can mint claims.  
Prevents unauthorized document creation.

### ✅ Claim Minting
Stores the following on-chain:
- Document hash
- Metadata
- Issuer address
- Timestamp
- Status
- Expiry
- Version links

Ensures tamper-proof academic credentials.

### ✅ Revoke System
- Updates on-chain status to **"revoked"**
- Mandatory reason code (e.g., fraudulent, error, disciplinary)
- Records timestamp + revoker address

Ensures transparent invalidation.

### ✅ Superseding
- Marks old documents as **"superseded"**
- Links to new version
- Preserves full version history

### ✅ Audit Events
- Emits ARC-4 events for every state change:
  - Issuance
  - Revocation
  - Superseding
- Creates immutable, transparent audit log

---

# 💻 Frontend (React + TypeScript)

### 🔄 Generated Client
AlgoKit generates a typed client from the ARC-56 ABI for type-safe contract calls.

### 👛 Wallet Integration
Pera Wallet Connect for issuers (whitelisted addresses only).

### 🔐 Authentication
Firebase Auth (Email + OTP) for students — no wallet required.

### 🗄 Storage
- Firebase Firestore → Student profiles & visibility settings
- IPFS (Pinata) → Document files

### 🔎 Indexer
Algorand Indexer for efficient claim retrieval without direct contract calls.

# ✨ Key Features Implemented

---

## 1️⃣ Zero-Friction Student Access (No Crypto Knowledge Required)

- Students log in with college email + OTP.
- No wallets or seed phrases required.
- Custodial wallets managed behind the scenes.
- Recruiters verify via magic email links (no Pera Wallet needed).

---

## 2️⃣ Complete Document Lifecycle with Visual Status Badges

Each document clearly displays:

- 🟢 **Active** – Currently valid  
- 🟡 **Expiring Soon** – Within 30 days  
- 🔴 **Expired** – Past expiry date  
- ❌ **Revoked** – Permanently invalidated (reason on hover)  
- 🔁 **Superseded** – Newer version exists (linked)

Provides instant clarity for students and verifiers.

---

## 3️⃣ Revocation with Reasons & Full Audit Trail

- Issuers must provide reason when revoking.
- All actions logged with timestamp + actor.
- Students can see who viewed their documents.
- Nothing can be deleted — complete transparency.

---

## 4️⃣ Version History (Superseded Documents)

- Updated documents create a new version.
- Old document marked as superseded.
- Verifiers see latest version by default.
- Full history available when needed.

---

## 5️⃣ Email-Based Document Sharing

- Students share documents using recruiter email.
- Recruiters receive time-limited, single-use magic link.
- No QR required — works remotely.

---

## 6️⃣ QR Code Sharing (In-Person Verification)

- Generate time-limited signed QR codes.
- Expiry options: 1h / 24h / 7d.
- Prevents screenshot reuse.
- Works with any camera — no app required.

---

## 7️⃣ Granular Privacy Controls

- Toggle visibility per document.
- Only visible documents appear in shares.
- Optional verifier-requested claims for finer control.

---

## 8️⃣ Hybrid Architecture (Blockchain + Database + IPFS)

### 🔐 Blockchain (Algorand)
Stores:
- Document hashes
- Issuer identity
- Timestamps
- Status

Tamper-proof & gas-efficient.

### ⚡ Database (Firebase)
Stores:
- Student profiles
- Visibility settings
- Access logs

Fast querying & flexible UI logic.

### 📦 IPFS
Stores:
- Encrypted document files
- Content-addressed & decentralized

Best of all worlds: **Security + Speed + Privacy**

---

## 9️⃣ Post-Quantum Readiness (Future-Proof)

Built on Algorand — the only blockchain with quantum-secure Falcon signatures.

Ensures long-term document trust even in a post-quantum world.

---

## 🔟 College-Friendly Admin Panel

- Issuers connect via Pera Wallet (whitelisted).
- Simple interface for document issuance.
- Full audit trail for all issued credentials.

# ⚠ Known Limitations

### 1. Email Service Simulation
Magic links are simulated (console logs only).

**Resolution:** Integrate SendGrid or AWS SES.

### 2. Offline Verification
No SMS-based verification.

**Resolution:** Twilio integration + signed offline proofs.


### 3. Document Encryption
IPFS files not encrypted at rest.

**Resolution:** Implement AES-256 client-side encryption.


### 4. Rate Limiting
Basic rate limiting only.

**Resolution:** Redis-based production throttling.


### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
Dashboard not fully optimized.

**Resolution:** Dedicated mobile UI components.


### 6. Scalability Testing
Not tested beyond:
- 1000 concurrent users
- 10,000 documents

**Resolution:** Load testing + indexer optimization.


### 7. Selective Disclosure
Students cannot reveal specific fields.

**Resolution:** ZK-proof based granular disclosure (Phase 3).


### 8. Cross-Institution Portability
Claims cannot transfer across institutions.

**Resolution:** State-proof-based transfer protocol.
