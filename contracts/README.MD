# Smart Contract

## 📌 Overview

It is an ARC-4 smart contract built on the Algorand blockchain.

It enables a college (admin) to:

- Issue placement claims for students
- Revoke issued claims
- Allow recruiters to verify all claims transparently

The contract ensures that only the admin (app creator) can issue or revoke claims.
